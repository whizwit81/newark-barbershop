# Problem Solved
Local barber shop relies solely on walk in customers with no clear idea of how much business they'll have for the day. Suggesting a scheduling feature on their website will allow them to have a better understanding of forecasting as well as being able to now have a database of customers they can market to in the future.

### As a customer, I should be able to schedule an appointment
- Given the customer clicks the "Schedule Haircut" button on the main page or clicks the "New Appointment" link in the nav bar, each link will take them to the "New Appointment" form to schedule. There they can select the Barber, Month, Day and time they would like their haircut. They cannot proceed without selecting one of each field. If they do so, a pop-up message will appear requiring this to be done. After clicking "Submit Appointment", they'll be taken to a confirmation page outlining the details. This page will also have a link back to the "My Account" page to edit.

### As a customer, I should be able to view my scheduled haircuts
- Given the customer has made and submitted a new appointment, the customer can click the "My Account" link in the Nav bar, or the text explaining how to edit or delete on the confirmation page. The "My Account" page will display all of the appointments the logged in user has scheduled.

### As a customer, I should be able to edit my haircut appointment
- Given the customer wants to edit, they can click on the text of the scheduled appointment, which will take them back to the "Edit" page. Here the form will be pre-filled with the previously selected data. Once the customer submits the changes, they'll be routed to the confirmation page displaying the updated schedule.

### As a customer, I should be able to cancel/delete my haircut appointment
- Given the customer wants to cancle/delete their appointment, they can click on the trash can button next to their scheduled appointment on the "My Account" page. This will remove the scheduled appointment from the database.
